# Basic Calculator App using Flutter

This is a Basic Calculator App built with flutter thats performs basic arithmetic operations like Addition, Subtraction, Division and Multiplication. I have used the GridView Widget in this project to create a grid of buttons, that makes easy to input numbers and operators for calculations.


## Features

- **C** button to reset input and output.
- **<-** button to delete last digit or character entered in the input field.
- Error handling for invalid inputs.
